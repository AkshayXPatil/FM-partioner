Fiduccia-Mattheyses method to bi-partition the ISPD 2016 benchmarks and minimized the cutset
- I did this project along with [Akash Tadmare](https://github.com/akash10295) as a part of Design Automation of VLSI systems course.
- In this project, we have developed a Fiduccia-Mattheyses(FM) method to bi-partition the ISPD 2016 benchmarks and minimized the cutset
- The [report](https://github.com/AkshayXPatil/FM-partioner/blob/master/report.pdf) file briefly explains the complete FM method and discusses about, how this method is used to bipartition the hypergraph model of a circuit. The report ends with discussion of results and final conclusion.
- [fmpart.cpp](https://github.com/AkshayXPatil/FM-partioner/blob/master/fmpart.cpp) is the C++ implementation of the FM method.
- This code is tested on [ISPD 2016 benchmark circuits](http://www.ispd.cc/contests/16/ispd2016_contest.html).
- [Readme.txt](https://github.com/AkshayXPatil/FM-partioner/blob/master/readme.txt) file explains the step by step procedure to execute the code.
