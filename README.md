# FM-partioner
Fiduccia-Mattheyses method to bi-partition the ISPD 2016 benchmarks and minimized the cutset
- I did this project along with Akash Tadmare as a part of Design Automation of VLSI systems course.
- In this project, we have developed a Fiduccia-Mattheyses (FM) method to bi-partition the ISPD 2016 benchmarks and minimized the cutset
- The report file briefly explains the complete FM method and discusses about, how this methos is used to bipartition the hypergraph model of a circuit. The report ends with discussion of results and final conclusion.
- fmpart.cpp is the C++ implementation of the FM method.
- This code is tested on ISPD 2016 benchmark circuits given in Benchmark circuits.zip file.
- Readme.txt file explains the step by step procedure to execute the code.
